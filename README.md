# Absenteeism-Analysis-Project-Udemy-Course

Overview
This project analyzes employee absenteeism data to uncover key patterns and insights, such as the reasons for absences, seasonal trends, and correlations with other variables. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making to reduce absenteeism and improve workplace efficiency.

Objectives
Identify significant factors influencing absenteeism.
Visualize the distribution of absence reasons and seasonal trends.
Provide actionable recommendations for reducing absenteeism.
Tools and Libraries
Python: Main programming language for analysis.
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: Mathematical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and prepared raw data for analysis.
Created dummy variables for categorical columns (e.g., reasons for absence).
Derived new features such as monthly and daily absenteeism patterns.
Data Visualization:

Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
Frequency and trend charts for absenteeism reasons.
Line plots to observe seasonal patterns (e.g., absenteeism by month).
Stacked bar charts for absenteeism distribution by day of the week and reasons.
Insights & Recommendations:

Highlighted significant findings, such as the impact of specific reasons for absence, peak absenteeism in March, and higher absenteeism on Mondays.
Proposed actions to address these patterns.
Key Findings
Reason 1 (e.g., health-related absences) is a significant contributor to absenteeism hours.
Transportation Expenses may slightly increase absenteeism, warranting transportation support initiatives.
March sees a significant spike in absenteeism, suggesting seasonal or event-specific factors.
Mondays have the highest absenteeism across all days of the week.
Future Work
Build predictive models for absenteeism forecasting.
Explore clustering techniques to identify subgroups of employees with distinct absenteeism patterns.
Expand analysis by incorporating external datasets (e.g., weather, public holidays).
